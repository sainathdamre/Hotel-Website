Rajgad Fort Pune has served as the residence of Shivaji Maharaj for 25 years. It has witnessed many historical events as its ownership got transferred from one ruler to another. Rajaram Chhatrapati, son of Shivaji Maharaj, was born here. Also, Saibai, queen of the Maratha Empire and wife of Shivaji, breathed her last inside the fort.

Apart from the Maratha empire, Rajgad Fort in Pune has been a part of the Adilshahi dynasty, Nizamshahi dynasty, Mughal empire and others. After everyone else, the British empire owned the fort.

    <p class="card-text">
<i>Lying on the western coast, Goa is India's smallest state and unlike any other, known for its endless beaches, stellar nightlife, eclectic seafood, world-heritage listed architecture. Spread across just 3,702 km, Goa lies in the Konkan region. It is a far cry from the hippie haven or a beach getaway, and one of the only few destinations that is open 24x7. The laid-backness (susegad) of Goa attracts as many international tourists as it does Indians, or even more so.
